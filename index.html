    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Roots rock, funk, punk, and klezmer—blended in the backwoods of Maine by the Shmutz Family.</p>
    
  </section>
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Band a History</h2>
    <p>Long before the first downbeat or tambourine shake, the Shmutz family had settled on a forgotten web of logging roads deep in Maine’s North Woods. Their grandparents, Moishe and Gertie Shmutz, were back-to-the-landers before it was cool—or safe. After escaping a condo association in Brighton Beach, they homesteaded near the Piscataquis River, living off potato kugel, fiddleheads, and sheer Yiddish stubbornness.</p>
    <p>The musical dynasty began unintentionally. The eldest sibling, <strong>Huxtable Maccabee Shmutz</strong>, was named for a beloved sitcom father known for slipping a mickey here and there. With a Stratocaster he rebuilt from junked snowmobile parts and a harmonica shaped like a shofar, Huxtable started writing songs about split wood, lost love, and cholent that wouldn’t quit.</p>
    <p>Next came <strong>Rhoda Shmutz</strong>, a rhythm guitarist whose voice “sounded like challah soaked in whiskey and left out in the rain,” according to one rave review in <em>The Bangor Monthly Jewish Review &amp; Bait Shop Digest</em>. She brought order to Huxtable’s chaos and introduced three-part harmonies, often mid-argument.</p>
    <p>Then came <strong>Belvedere Shmutz</strong>, bass player and amateur Talmudist. He could switch from upright to electric without breaking eye contact, once famously quoting Rabbi Akiva while soloing during a storm at the Unity Fair. He also sells smoked sable and homegrown medicinal cannabis he affectionally calls “Bubbe’s Bubonic Chronic" out of a truck with no brakes.</p>
    <p>Rounding out the band was their oddball cousin, <strong>Frasier “Circumcised Sticks” Shmutz</strong>, a percussionist who only plays standing up, always barefoot, and once used a box of stale matzah as a snare. He’s known for wearing only linen and claiming he speaks fluent Ladino “when the moon is right.”</p>
    <p>The band might’ve remained an obscure North Woods legend, playing Shabbos barn hoedowns and moose-benefit picnics, if not for Cousin Archie Bunker Shmutz, an amateur drone hobbyist and seasonal RV repairman. In 2021, Archie backed over the family’s only StarLink dish while chasing a raccoon with a hot dog tong.</p>
    <p>Cut off from the outside world, the Shmutz siblings did what Jews have always done in exile: they made art.  A flurry of songwriting followed.</p>
    <p>Word of mouth spread.  A Maine Public segment titled <em>Klezmer in the Kingdom of Spruce</em> brough them cult status.  A viral TikTok of Frasier playing bongos on a stump during a fox mating season riot cemented their legend.</p>
